# Large Class

## Signs & Symptoms
A class contains many fields, methods, lines of code. Serves multiple responsibilities.

## Reason for the problem
Classes usually starts small, but over time they get bloated. Programmers usually find it mentally less taxing to place a new feature in an existing class than to create a new class for the feature.

## Treatment
When a class is wearing to many functional hats, think about splitting it.
> * **Extract Class** helps if part of the behavior of large class can be spun of into a separate component.
> * **Extract Subclass** helps if part of the behavior of large class can be implemented in different ways or is used in rare cases.
> * **Extract Interface** helps if it's necessary to have a list of the operations and behaviors that the client can use.
> * If a large class is responsible for the graphical interface, you may try to move some of its data and behavior to a separate domain object. In doing so it may be necessary to store copies of some data in two places and keep the data consistent. **Duplicate Observed Data** offers a way to do this.


## Payoff
* Refactoring classes, spares developers from needing to remember a large number of attributes for a class.
* In many cases, splitting large classes into parts avoids duplication of code and functionality.
