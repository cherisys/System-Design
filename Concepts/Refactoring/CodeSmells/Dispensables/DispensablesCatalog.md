### What are Dispensables?
Something pointless and unneeded whose absence would make code cleaner, efficient and easier to understand.

## 1. Duplicate Code
Two code fragments look almost identical.

## 2. Data Class
A data class refers to a class that contains only fields and crude methods for accessing them (getters and setters). These are simply containers for data used by other classes.

## 3. Dead Code
A variable, parameter, field, method, or class is no longer used (become obsolete).

## 4. Lazy Class
Maintaining classes cost time and money. If a class doesn't do enough to earn your attention, it should be deleted.

## 5. Speculative Generality
There's an unused class, method, field, or parameter.

## 6. Comments
A method is filled with explanatory comments.
