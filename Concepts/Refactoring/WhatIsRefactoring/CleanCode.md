### Clean code is obvious for other programmers
Poor variable naming, bloated classes and methods, magic numbers, and everything that makes code sloppy and difficult to grasp.

### Clean code doesn't contain duplicataion
Each time you change, remember to change in every instance. This increases cognitive load and slows down the progress.

### Clean code contains minimal number of classes and other moving parts
Less code is about ease, less maintenance, fewer bugs. Code is liability, keep it short and simple.

### Clean code passes all tests
You know code is dirty when only 95% of tests pass. You know you're screwed when your test coverage is 0%.

### Clean code is easier and cheaper to maintain
