# What is Refactoring?
Refactoring is a systematic process of improving code without creating new functionality. It can transform a mess into **Clean Code** and **Simple Design**.

## Dirty Code
Dirty code is result of inexperience multiplied by tight deadlines, mismanagement, and nasty shortcuts taken during development process.

## Clean Code
Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand and maintain. Clean code makes software development predictable and increases the quality of a resulting product.

## Code Smells
Code smells are indicators of problems that can be addressed during refactoring. Code smells are easy to spot and fix, but they maybe just symptoms of a deeper problem with code.

## Refactoring Techniques
Refactoring techniques describe refactoring steps. Most refactoring techniques have their pros and cons. Therefore, each refactoring should be properly motivated and applied with caution.

## Refactoring Process
Performing refactoring step-by-step and running tests after each change are key elements of refactoring that make it predictable and safe.
