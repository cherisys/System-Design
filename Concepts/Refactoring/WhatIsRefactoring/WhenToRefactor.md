## Rule of Three
1. When you're doing something at first time, just get it done.
2. When you're doing something similar for the second time, cringe at having to repeat but do the same thing anyway.
3. When you're doing something for the third time, start refactoring.

## When adding a feature
* Refactoring helps you understand other people's code. If you've to deal with someone's dirty code, try to refactor it first.
* Clean code is much easier to grasp. You'll improve it not only for yourself but also for those who use it after you.
* Refactoring makes it easier to add new features. It's much easier to make changes in clean code.

## When fixing a bug
* Bugs in code behave just like in real life: they live in darkest, dirtiest places in code.
* Clean your code and the errors will practically discover themselves.
* Proactive refactoring eliminates the need for special refactoring tasks later.

## During a code review
* Code review maybe the last chance to tidy up the code before it becomes available to the public.
* Perform such reviews in a pair with the author, this way simple issues can be fixed quickly, and you can gauge the time for fixing the more difficult issues.
